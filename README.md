## ðŸ“Š Highlighted Projects

### [Credit Default Risk Prediction](https://github.com/abisola-joy/Credit-Default-Risk)
**Objective**: Predict loan defaults using machine learning and deep learning models on LendingClub loan data.

- **Data**: LendingClub loan data (2007-2018)
- **Models Used**: Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and MLP (with 3 hidden layers)
- **Ensemble Technique Used**: Voting and Stacking
  
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Implemented feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV).
  - Applied stratified sampling and class imbalance techniques to improve model performance.
  - Evaluated models using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and AUC.
  - Conducted SHAP analysis for model interpretability and deployed the model for decision-making.

This project demonstrating my expertise in predictive modeling, hyperparameter tuning, and model interpretability within the credit risk domain.

**NOTE**: Developed for my disseration for Sheffield Hallam University's Big Data Analytics course.

### [Intelligent Service Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/abisola-joy/Intelligent-Service-Recommendation-Engine)
**Objective**: Developed a recommendation system to enhance customer engagement and boost sales for an online book-selling platform.

- **Techniques**: Collaborative filtering with Pearson correlation, Cosine similarity, and Minkowski distance.

- **Key Contributions**:
  - Designed and implemented an interactive recommendation engine to generate personalized book recommendations.
  - Built a user-friendly interface for browsing recommendations and viewing details.
  - Ensured efficient handling of missing data and system errors for robust performance.

This project showcases my proficiency in data analysis, algorithm implementation, and user interface design, providing a practical solution to the challenge of information overload in online content consumption.

**NOTE**: Developed as part of an assignment for Sheffield Hallam University's Big Data Analytics course.

### [Heart Failure Prediction](https://github.com/abisola-joy/Heart-Failure-Prediction)
**Objective**: Developed machine learning models to predict heart failure outcomes based on patient data.

- **Models Used**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, MLP
  
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Conducted extensive data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation.
  - Tackled class imbalance issues with SMOTE and other techniques.
  - Analysed feature importance using Chi-Square tests and statistical significance tests.

This project demonstrating my expertise in predictive modeling, hyperparameter tuning, and model interpretability within the credit risk domain.

**NOTE**: Developed as part of an assignment for Sheffield Hallam University's Big Data Analytics course.

## ðŸŒŸ Featured Contributions
