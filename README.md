## ðŸ“Š Projects

### [Intelligent Service Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/abisola-joy/Intelligent-Service-Recommendation-Engine)
Developed as part of an assignment for Sheffield Hallam University's Big Data Analytics course, the Book Recommendation System is an intelligent service recommendation engine designed to improve sales for an online book-selling company. As the data engineer responsible for the project, my key contributions included:

- Analysing the problem of recommendation systems and designing a solution based on collaborative filtering techniques.
- Implementing modules for loading user and book datasets, computing similarity between users and books, and generating recommendations.
- Employing various similarity measures such as Pearson correlation coefficient, cosine similarity, and Minkowski distance to calculate similarities between users or books.
- Creating an interactive interface for users to browse recommendations, view book details, and explore different similarity measures.
- Ensuring robust error handling to gracefully handle missing or invalid data, enhancing the reliability of the recommendation engine.

The Book Recommendation System showcases my proficiency in data analysis, algorithm implementation, and user interface design, providing a practical solution to the challenge of information overload in online content consumption.

### [Heart Failure Prediction](https://github.com/abisola-joy/Heart-Failure-Prediction)
Developed as part of an assignment for Sheffield Hallam University's Big Data Analytics course, the Heart Failure Prediction project aims to analyse and evaluate heart failure prediction models using machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques. As the lead developer for this project, my key responsibilities included:

- Conducting exploratory data analysis to identify missing data, perform data preprocessing, and analyse descriptive statistics.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets and fitting machine learning algorithms including NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest classifier, K-Nearest Neighbour, and Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks.
- Evaluating model performance using test data and reporting accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score.
- Investigating class imbalance problems and applying techniques to balance class distribution.
- Analysing feature significance using statistical tests like Mann-Whitney and Chi-Square tests and selecting relevant features for prediction.

The Heart Failure Prediction project demonstrates my proficiency in data analysis, machine learning model development, and healthcare analytics, contributing to better decision-making in healthcare settings.
