### [Intelligent Service Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/abisola-joy/Intelligent-Service-Recommendation-Engine)
Developed as part of an assignment for Sheffield Hallam University's Big Data Analytics course, the Book Recommendation System is an intelligent service recommendation engine designed to improve sales for an online book-selling company. As the data engineer responsible for the project, my key contributions included:

- Analysing the problem of recommendation systems and designing a solution based on collaborative filtering techniques.
- Implementing modules for loading user and book datasets, computing similarity between users and books, and generating recommendations.
- Employing various similarity measures such as Pearson correlation coefficient, cosine similarity, and Minkowski distance to calculate similarities between users or books.
- Creating an interactive interface for users to browse recommendations, view book details, and explore different similarity measures.
- Ensuring robust error handling to gracefully handle missing or invalid data, enhancing the reliability of the recommendation engine.

The Book Recommendation System showcases my proficiency in data analysis, algorithm implementation, and user interface design, providing a practical solution to the challenge of information overload in online content consumption.
